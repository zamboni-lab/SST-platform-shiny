# SST-platform-shiny

We used R Shiny framework to implement a web-service, providing users with graphical representation of the data and analytics. The layout contains three tabs: _summary_, _trends_ and _table_ components. The _summary_ tab allows users to select a QC run by date and to see how the corresponding quality indicators are aligned against the full dataset. Score of the selected run and the distributions for each metric are displayed. The _trends_ tab depicts temporal progression for the selected indicator, marking overall run qualities. This allows to see and analyze each metric’s behavior retrospectively. Linear trends are computed and visualized as well, which helps detecting gradual loss of sensitivity, gain of dirt in the system, etc. Finally, the _table_ tab explicitly shows the values of the quality indicators from the database. Values classified as “good” or “bad” are colored in green and red, respectively.
